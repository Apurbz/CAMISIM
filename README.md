MetagenomeSimulationPipeline
================

This is a pipeline for the simulation of a metagenome.

This repository contains all the individual steps to simulate metagenomic shotgun samples.

##Dependancies

The following software is required for the simulation pipeline to run:

####[python 2.7.10](https://www.python.org/)

Python is the programming language most scripts were written in

####[Perl 5](https://www.perl.org/)

Perl 5 is a programming language, used in the script that generates a perfect assembly from bam files

####[ART](http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art/)

ART is a set of simulation tools to generate synthetic next-generation sequencing reads.

####[SAMtools 1.0](http://www.htslib.org/)
